Hierarchical Variational Graph-Fused Lasso (HVGFL)

This repository contains the code used in the paper “Hierarchical Variational Graph-Fused Lasso for Recovering Relative Rates in Spatial Compositional Data.”

It implements a Bayesian spatial modeling framework for compositional data, combining hierarchical modeling, variational inference, and graph-fused lasso priors. The code includes everything needed to reproduce the paper’s results, including both simulations and real-world datasets.
